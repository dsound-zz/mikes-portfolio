    <p>I'm a guy who likes to draw. When I sit in my bathtub, I make drawings. I like motorcycles. I like weed wackers and chainsaws.
        If you like what I do, why haven't you contact me yet? What's the deal. I lived in Lyons, Il. for a while. I 
        live in the Charolette area now. What else do you want to know? You got to tell me.
